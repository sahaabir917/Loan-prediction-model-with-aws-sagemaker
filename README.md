Loan Approval Prediction with AWS SageMaker & Lambda
This project demonstrates how to train, deploy, and serve an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for loan approval prediction using AWS cloud services.

 Features
 Preprocesses and cleans loan application data

 Trains an ANN classifier using TensorFlow on AWS SageMaker

 Saves model artifacts, scalers, and evaluation metrics

 Deploys the model as a SageMaker endpoint

 Wraps the prediction logic in an AWS Lambda function

 Exposes the model through a RESTful API via API Gateway

 Tech Stack:
 Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn

 Cloud Services: AWS SageMaker, AWS Lambda, S3, API Gateway

 Deployment: Serverless API for real-time loan approval predictions
